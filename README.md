This is my (Brandon Pham's) READ.MD for the CIS 7 course project. 
I chose project case 3 --  Vigenere Cipher Decryption.

General project description: This project case asks to create a C++ program that encrypt and decrypts a message from the user. 

Programming approaches: to program in C++ and also to apply material from class learned to this project. 

Authors: Brandon Pham (no group) 

Date published: 6/7/2023 

Basic insutrctuons on how to use the program: Press run and then type strings for encrytion and decryption one at a time.
